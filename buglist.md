* Carousel controls appear on top of the carousel slide, obstructing the view
    * Change carousel to something else... just a simple grid view with buttons on the sides to move between hours?
* Page reload behavior is unexpected (gets rid of current search)

## P1
* Location submit behavior has no error messaging or options
* Search Bar is too wide
