My first React project - a weather app!

View a live demo [here]()

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The goal of this project was to make a functional weather website using React, Bootstrap, and the free weather API at https://www.weatherapi.com/
